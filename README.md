# Multicart Products (Magento 2.3.x)

Multicart products for Magento 2.3.x allows admins to setup multiple add to carts on selective products.

### How to activate

- Enable/ Disable is not available in this module, therefore if you don't want to use, simply remove or set the field to empty value or change to something else.
- You have to select attribute you want to use as multicart sku search (seperated by quoma) under `Store > Configuration > Catalog > Catalog > MultiCart Configuration` and select the attribute you want to act as multicart input field.

### TODO

- There is no exception handling for choosing select field and neither its behavior is tested.
- You have to use at your own risk.
